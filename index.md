### About me
Hello, my name is Alex M. A. K. and I'm a systems engineer (confirmation is the first step to recovery, right?). 
I'm 30. I am married, have three children and live in Almaty, Kazakhstan.

I've been passionate about software development since the day I first got access to the "ZX Spectrum" computer, yeah, maybe it's not cool because there are people who were already working when I was born.))))
In total, my experience in the field of IT-technologies, a little over 20 years, but if we consider it officially about 11, because I started making money on programming about 10-11 years ago.
I like to write on: C / C++, Python, Lua, Go, most of my projects are written on them, unfortunately I can't share the code with you because NDA.
I participated in closed-door projects to integrate equipment (such as audio and video analyzers, audio weeds, TV channel monitoring systems and more) into Zabbix monitoring system.
I develop software for original devices based on AVR/STM32/PIC microcontrollers.
I had to deal with reverse engineering.
I develop modules and classes of CMDBuild system for Kazniie Innovation LLP. 
In General, there were many different, but always want more, so I started freelance)
All my free time I do self-study, I like to write code, I like to study technologies, but I don't like frameworks, but they make the work easier.

Nice to meet you!
